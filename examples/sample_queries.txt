## Notes on Model Selection in OpenRouter
- For reasoning-heavy queries (e.g., comparisons, explanations): Use Claude models like anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet for superior analytical capabilities.
- For general factual or how-to questions: GPT-4 models like openai/gpt-4o or openai/gpt-4o-mini offer balanced performance and cost.
- For cost-effective responses on simpler queries: Llama models like meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct provide good quality at lower prices.
- Always check https://openrouter.ai/models for the latest pricing, context windows, and availability. Switch models via OPENROUTER_MODEL in .env for testing different behaviors.
